"Topological gene-expression networks recapitulate brain anatomy and function" by Patania A. et al. (2018)

## Content:
1. data:
    - dataset normalized
    - the two list of genes used in the study
3. code:
    - mapper: All the functions
    - choice of parameters: script - enter dataset, exit parameters
    - agreement matrix : enter parameters, exit matrix
    - shortest path: enter network, exit distribution on nodes
    - agreement matrix (for subset of the samples): enter parameteres and subset, exit matrix
4. Description on how to run all of it
5. Tests (in the future)
